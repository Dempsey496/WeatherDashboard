# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
* URL live: https://dempsey496.github.io/WeatherDashboard/

* First time done was create a jumbotron which displays the month, day, and year when the page is loaded. This was accomplised using Moment.

* I then created the element IDs in the html so I would have something to target with jquery.

* I then begin my Ajax calls, the first was used to look up _Lon_ and _Lat_, which in turn are used to put into my second Ajax call so more in depth data could be used (such as UV and 7 day forecast).

* Using Jquery I then prepended the targeted results to pre-exsisting ID elements.
